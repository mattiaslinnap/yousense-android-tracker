Energy-efficent motion and location tracker for Android.
Based on Mattias's power and tracking work.

Not exactly sure what the license of this code will be, and how it will be published.
I have 3 plans for it:
1. Share it with lab people for inclusion in any experimental projects,
2. Maybe publish it as GPL on my github - but only after I have a paper out that academic users could cite, and a running PSensing project that other users can find and download,
3. Maybe publish it as MIT/Apache some day, so that it could be used by random developers (including myself after PhD). But not sure.

I would not like to open-source it to the entire world before I have released my own projects/papers that I can advertise with it.
Using it in lab experiments, and releasing it as part of closed-source apps is fine right now too.

Please ask if you would like any help or have any questions.
