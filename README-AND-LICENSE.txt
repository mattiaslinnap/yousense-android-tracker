Energy-efficent motion and location tracker for Android.
Based on Mattias's power and tracking work.

I plan to release it as GPL, once I have a paper published that goes with it. Might also release it under a MIT/Apache.

Anyone in the lab is of course free to use it for any project, any time, including public research or fun apps.
But please don't publish the source code to the tracker itself until I have a paper to go with it.

Please ask if you would like any help or have any questions.
